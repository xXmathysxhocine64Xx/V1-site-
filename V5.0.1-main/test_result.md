FINDINGS: ✅ Badge Location: Successfully located Infrastructure Active badge on /accueil page. ❌ MISALIGNMENT DETECTED: Precise measurements show 8px X-axis and 8px Y-axis misalignment between pulse and ping animations. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Both dots use 'absolute inset-0' positioning, but animate-ping scales to 2x size (16x16px) with transform matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, -4, -4). The -4px offset is mathematically correct but visually creates misalignment due to absolute positioning conflicts. 📐 TECHNICAL DETAILS: Dot 1 (pulse): 8x8px at position x=225, y=328.125. Dot 2 (ping): 16x16px at position x=217, y=320.125. 🛠️ SOLUTION ATTEMPTED: Modified structure to use flexbox centering approach (relative flex items-center justify-center) but build issues prevented testing. ⚠️ STATUS: User report of persistent misalignment is 100% accurate - dots are NOT perfectly superposed despite previous 'working: true' status."
